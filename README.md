# Algore.Practice

Collection of Algorithm challenges and their respective solutions. The goal is to walk and work through these challenges to get a firm understanding of how to solve these challenges, before conferring with the [Interview Cake](interviewcake.com) solution to compare and contrast the approaches as well as Space and Time Complexities => Big O.

## Interview Cake

This is without a doubt one of the best resources that exists today to teach you the fundamentals of how to think about Data Structures and solving Algorithms. Really love that the readings are free(tbh, I would have been happy to pay for this too), but to view the very well thought explanations, you'd need to pay.

## How to use this

> NB All of the problems assume a Javascript environment

Each file contains a solution for one challenge. Details of the challenge are in the "front matter" or documentation of the page. To run, you'd need to have [NodeJS](nodejs.com) installed. Simply navigate to the folder where you've cloned this repository to, and then run with Node. For instance, to run the `reverse-array-in-place.js`, in your terminal, run

```
node reverse-array-in-place.js
```

If you have issues with running any of these, or you want to highlight an alternative appraoch, feel free to raise issues and/or PRs.

Cheers.
